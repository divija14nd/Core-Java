 * A triangle is represented by its 3 sides such that the sum of any 
 * two sides is greater than the third. Write a class to represent a 
 * triangle given 3 sides and to find its perimeter and area. Area using 
 * Heronâ€™s formula sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) where s = (a+b+c)/2. 
 * If the triangle is invalid, the perimeter and area must be -1. 
 * Read the 3 sides as input from the user and print the area and perimeter. 
 * Write methods isEquilateral(), isScalene() and isIsosceles(), isRightAngled() 
 * which will return true or false based on whether the triangle is equilateral, 
 * isosceles, scalene or right-angled.*/
